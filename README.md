# Visit Budapest

The Visit Budapest website was created to help people plan a short visit to Budapest, Hungary. It's aim is to offer a few ideas on sights, activities and accomodation. The aim was to include at least one in each category that'll be new to even the regular visitors to the city.
I hope you'll find the information contained within both useful and inspiring and you'll enjoy your visit to Budapest!

## Credits 

The general idea of the layout is based on the Code Institue's Love Running project, however no large chunks of HTML or CSS code were taken directly from it. Some of the design ideas were taken from other websites but no code was directly copied from them.
Code snippets on websites such as Stack Overflow or W3schools.com were also checked for reference purposes.
